# collector 0.0.0.9000

* Reference CRAN versions of `xaringan`
* `make_slides()` properly escapes unicode for the default title slide.
* `check_readability()` now uses the CRAN-published `quanteda` library in 
place of the archived `readability`.
* Added a `NEWS.md` file to track changes to the package.
